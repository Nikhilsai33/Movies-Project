# Collaborative Filtering for Movie Recommendation

## Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model for collaborative filtering to predict movie ratings based on user interactions. The goal is to recommend movies by analyzing past user behavior and predicting potential movie ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- User IDs
- Movie IDs
- Ratings given by users
- Additional metadata (if available)

## Project Tasks
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the dataset.
- Handle missing values.
- Convert categorical variables into numerical values.
- Normalize the ratings.

### 2. Building the Collaborative Filtering Model
- Train a deep learning-based recommendation model using PyTorch.
- Utilize embeddings to represent users and movies in a latent space.
- Optimize the model using appropriate loss functions and hyperparameters.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model using validation data.
- Compare predicted ratings with actual ratings.
- Use metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to assess performance.

### 4. Movie Recommendation Analysis
- Generate predictions for unseen data.
- Analyze the predicted ratings.
- Identify top recommended movies for different users.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. It explores different techniques to predict movie ratings and generate meaningful recommendations based on user behavior.
